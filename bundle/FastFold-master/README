Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method other
than `manual`), bog down VIM noticeably in insert mode and are often
recomputed too early (for example, when inserting an opening fold marker
whose closing counterpart is yet missing.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text
for a discussion.

With this plug-in, the folds in the currently edited buffer are updated by an
automatic fold method only

- when saving the buffer
- when closing or opening folds (zo, za, zc, etc...)
- when moving or operating fold-wise (zj,zk,[z,]z)
- when typing `zuz` in normal mode

and are kept as is otherwise (by keeping the fold method set to `manual`).

Each of the above triggers can be changed by in your `.vimrc` by changing
the values

  nmap zuz <Plug>(FastFoldUpdate)
  let g:fastfold_savehook = 1
  let g:fastfold_fold_command_suffixes =  ['x','X','a','A','o','O','c','C']
  let g:fastfold_fold_movement_commands = [']z', '[z', 'zj', 'zk']
